# netflix-cve-2019-10028

This is a demo for Mayhem on [netflix-cve-2019-10028](https://github.com/ForAllSecure/VulnerabilitiesLab/tree/master/netflix-cve-2019-10028).

  * `vulnerable` has everything you need to reproduce the vulnerability quickly.
    Just `cd vulnerable && mayhem run .`. 
  * `fixed` runs Mayhem on the latest version of netflix dial. I have
    specifically turned off advanced triage so that the regression is clean.
  * `fixed-advanced` enabled advanced triage. As of 1/19/2021, netflix dial
    still has memory leaks that mayhem correctly identifies. However, I have
    this as an optional run because it takes a bit more time to explain in a
    demo situation.
    
This demo is optimized to run on our demo instance. To make work on any other
instance, you would need to a) push the docker image to the right place (or
dockerhub), and b) update the Mayhemfile to point to that image.
